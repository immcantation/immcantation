* The |airr_c| of The Antibody Society is a research-driven group that is 
  organizing and coordinating stakeholders in the use of next-generation 
  sequencing technologies to study antibody/B-cell  and T-cell receptor 
  repertoires.  The Community also organizes meetings and workshops 
  to report progress in the field and promote its standards as well as 
  |airr_webinars| and |airr_seminars| to promote AIRR-seq related research.
